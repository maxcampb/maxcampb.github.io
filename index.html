    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>I discover patterns, provide insights, and solve problems in complex systems using code and applied mathematical and statistical modeling techniques. To see some of my code, take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/maxcampb/Code_showcase">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>I would love to have a career that incorporates using quantitative methods to help solve "real-world" problems, particularly across the environmental, social, and financial domains. I also enjoy working as part of a team.</p>
    <p>I believe in always looking for personal and professional growth in my life to drive making positive impacts.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Changing multistressor interactions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented statistical analysis of complex ecological datasets to investigate the interactions between multiple stressors on marine ecosystems</li>
        <li>Developed R packages to automate data processing, model fitting, and result visualization</li>
        <li>Published research findings in Campbell et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2022.104757">2022</a>)</li>
        <li>Addressed challenges such as spatial autocorrelation, collinearity, and pseudoreplication using appropriate statistical techniques</li>
        <li>Provided code and documentation on GitHub for reproducibility (<a href="https://github.com/maxcampb/Multistressor_interactions">see code</a>)</li>

      <h3>Chemoinformatics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Collaboration with two chemists resulting in the publication Voser et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d1np00051a">2022</a>)</li>
        <li>I was the primary developer of the statistical procedures used in a complex analysis to determine the similarities among over 50,000 molecules. Here we used a two-step modelling approach, first we used a logistic principal component analysis to reduce the number of dimensions of molecular "fingerprints", and second we modelled the relationship between molecular structure and biological activity using GAMMs.</li>
        <li>Resulted in multiple conference presentations including a finalist for best presentation at the annual conference of the Statistical Society of Australia, and ultimately a publication in the New Phytologist.</li>
