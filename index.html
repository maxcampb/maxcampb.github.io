    <h3>Seagrass recovery modelling (in Prep.)</h3>
    <p>Co-developed the method, wrote all the code, and independently undertook all the analyses</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Used a combination of dynamical systems, graph theory, stochastic modelling, principal component analysis (PCA) and generalised additive mixed models (GAMM)</li>
      <li>Ran over 1,000,000 simulations on heavily optimised code on a remote server</li>
      <li>Provides useful insights into ecological systems and practical advice to environmental managers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Evaluating multiple stressors (Turschwell et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14013">2022</a>, King et al. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0348">2022</a>)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Turschwell et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14013">2022</a>) I helped determine the appropriate mathematical methods to investigate changing multistressor relationships over time. I found the 1D analytical solutions of the ODE systems, undertook the stability analyses and computed the jacobian matrices of the 2D ODE systems, generated the phase diagrams, wrote several mathematical sections of the manuscript and made major restructures of the <a href="https://github.com/mpturschwell/Seagrass_multiple_stressors">code</a></li>
      <li>In King et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0348">2022</a>) I helped develop and implement the methods to determine the interactions between multiple stressors over time in four ecological experiments. We first used generalised additive models to capture the effects of stressors through time on two ecological endpoints whilst accounting for pseudoreplication. We then used an empirical bayesian approach to investigate the range of stressor interactions (<a href="https://github.com/oliviakpj/Changing_multistressor_interactions">see code</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chemoinformatics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaboration with two chemists resulting in the publication Voser et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d1np00051a">2022</a>)</li>
      <li>I was the primary developer of the statistical procedures used in a complex analysis to determine the similarities among over 50,000 molecules. Here we used a two-step modelling approach, first we used a logistic principal component analysis to reduce the number of dimensions of molecular "fingerprints", and then used k-means clustering to determine similarities among molecules</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tuna project</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Brown et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104664">2021</a>) I wrangled and matched complex fisheries catch data from several different countries to create a clean dataset. I then applied the multivariate bayesian regression models in the R package 'boral' to investigate correlations among the catch of different species</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other projects</h3>
    <p>I am a coauthor on several other scientific papers for my work on statistics and computing (Molinari et al. 2021, Brown et al. 2020), and there are several other manuscripts where I am a coauthor in preparation.</p>
