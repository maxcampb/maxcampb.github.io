    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a data scientist with a passion for using code and applied mathematical and statistical modeling techniques to discover patterns, provide insights, and solve problems in complex systems. If you want to see some of my code, check out my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/maxcampb/Code_showcase">here</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm always on the lookout for exciting opportunities that allow me to apply my quantitative skills to solve real-world problems. I'm particularly interested in working across environmental, social, and financial domains. Plus, I thrive when collaborating with a team!</p>
    <p>I believe in continuous personal and professional growth, as it helps me make a meaningful impact in my life and the lives of others.</p>
