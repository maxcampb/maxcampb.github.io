    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
      <div>
        <p>
          I am a passionate data scientist with a strong background in statistical modelling and ecosystem research. I
          specialize in discovering patterns, providing insights, and solving problems within complex systems through
          the use of code, applied mathematical models, and statistical techniques. You can find some of my code
          examples on my <a href="https://github.com/maxcampb/Code_showcase">GitHub</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          My career aspiration is to utilize quantitative methods to address "real-world" challenges, particularly in
          the environmental, social, and financial domains. I thrive in collaborative team environments and believe in
          constantly seeking personal and professional growth to make positive impacts.

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <div>
      <h3>Seagrass recovery modelling (in Prep.)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Co-developed the method, wrote all the code, and independently undertook all the analyses</li>
        <li>Used a combination of dynamical systems, graph theory, stochastic modelling, principal component analysis
          (PCA) and generalised additive mixed models (GAMM)</li>
        <li>Ran over 1,000,000 simulations on heavily optimised code on a remote server</li>
        <li>Provides useful insights into ecological systems and practical advice to environmental managers.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Evaluating multiple stressors </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>In Turschwell et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14013">2022</a>), I helped determine the
          appropriate mathematical methods to investigate changing multi-stressor relationships over time. I found the
          1D
          analytical solutions of the ODE systems undertook the stability analyses and computed the Jacobian matrices
          of the 2D ODE systems, generated the phase diagrams, wrote several mathematical sections of the manuscript and
          made major restructures of the <a href="https://github.com/mpturschwell/Seagrass_multiple_stressors">code</a>.
        </li>
        <li>In King et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0348">2022</a>), I helped develop and implement
          the methods to determine the interactions between multiple stressors over time in four ecological experiments.
          We first used generalised additive models to capture the effects of stressors through time on two ecological
          endpoints whilst accounting for pseudoreplication. We then used an empirical bayesian approach to investigate
          the range of stressor interactions (<a
            href="https://github.com/oliviakpj/Changing_multistressor_interactions">see code</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>GitHub Collaboration framework</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Established a coding and data management framework for the research group with >10 members using a
          combination
          of Git, GitHub, and cloud storage</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Chemoinformatics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Collaboration with two chemists resulting in the publication of Voser et al. (<a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1039/d1np00051a">2022</a>)</li>
        <li>I was the primary developer of the statistical procedures used in a complex analysis to determine the
          similarities among over 50,000 molecules. Here we used a two-step modelling approach, first, we used a
          logistic
          principal component analysis to reduce the number of dimensions of molecular "fingerprints", and then used
          k-means clustering to determine similarities among molecules.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Tuna project</h3>
      <p>In Brown et al. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104664">2021</a>), I wrangled and matched
        complex fisheries catch data from several different countries to create a clean dataset. I then applied the
        multivariate bayesian regression models in the R package 'boral' to investigate correlations among the catch of
        different species.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Other projects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I am a coauthor on several other scientific papers for my work on statistics and computing (Molinari et al.
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2020.1843932">2021</a>, Brown et al. <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15472">2020</a>), and there are several other manuscripts where I am a
          coauthor in preparation.

      <h2>Sporting</h2>
      <p>
        I have played underwater hockey competitively for the past eight years, being selected in the state team five
        times (once as Captain), playing in many A-grade regional teams (often as Captain or Vice Captain, with several
        gold medals), and being selected as a reserve for the 2020 Australian Team. I have been heavily involved in the
        management and development of underwater hockey on the Gold Coast, Australia. I co-founded an underwater hockey
        club called Griffith Marlins and have been involved in various capacities during the last five years. This
        included winning grants, negotiating pool time, managing finances, mediating disputes, organizing team travel
        and accommodation, addressing behavioural issues, making team selections, and marketing the club. In late 2021,
        my partner and I handed over the management of the club to a new team. For these efforts, I was awarded the 2021
        Australian Underwater Federation Queensland Sportsperson of the Year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also enjoy running and hiking, which has led me to undertake the following adventures:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gold Coast Marathon</li>
        <li>GRUNT Half Marathon (3rd place)</li>
        <li>Huayna Potosi summit (6088m)</li>
        <li>Hinchinbrook Island hike (32km)</li>
        <li>Lara Pinta hike (230km)</li>
        <li>South Coast Track hike (84km)</li>
